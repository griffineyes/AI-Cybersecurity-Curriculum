The AI Red Teamer Job Role Path, in collaboration with Google, trains cybersecurity professionals to assess, exploit, and secure AI systems. Covering prompt injection, model privacy attacks, adversarial AI, supply chain risks, and deployment threats, it combines theory with hands-on exercises. Aligned with Googleâ€™s Secure AI Framework (SAIF), it ensures relevance to real-world AI security challenges. Learners will gain skills to manipulate model behaviors, develop AI-specific red teaming strategies, and perform offensive security testing against AI-driven applications. The path will be gradually expanded with related modules until its completion.
