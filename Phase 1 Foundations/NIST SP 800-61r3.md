# NIST SP 800-61r3  
  
  
## **Overview**  
  
NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 3 (SP 800-61r3) was published on April 3, 2025, and is titled "Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management: A CSF 2.0 Community Profile." This publication supersedes SP 800-61 Rev. 2, which was published in August 2012.  
  
## **Purpose and Scope**  
  
The publication seeks to assist organizations with incorporating cybersecurity incident response recommendations and considerations throughout their cybersecurity risk management activities as described by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. The goal is to help organizations prepare for incident responses, reduce the number and impact of incidents that occur, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their incident detection, response, and recovery activities.  
  
## **Key Transformations from Revision 2**  
  
**1. Alignment with CSF 2.0**  
  
The most transformative change in Revision 3 is its full alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, organizing incident response activities across all six CSF functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This alignment brings strategic cohesion between incident response and broader cybersecurity operations, encouraging organizations to treat incident response not as a siloed activity, but as an integrated component of enterprise risk management.  
  
**2. Updated Incident Response Lifecycle**  
  
The new incident response lifecycle model reflects that the preparation activities of Govern, Identify, and Protect are not part of the incident response itself, but rather are broader cybersecurity risk management activities that support incident response. The model emphasizes continuous improvement, with lessons learned from performing all activities in all Functions being fed into the Improvement Category within the Identify Function.  
  
**3. Shift to Dynamic, Web-Based Resources**  
  
Rather than overloading the publication with static content, NIST has introduced a web-based companion hub for SP 800-61r3 that includes real-world use cases, templates, and evolving best practices that are regularly updated. This approach acknowledges that details of how to perform incident response activities change frequently and vary significantly across technologies, environments, and organizations.

## **Practical Implications**  
  
This revision represents a paradigm shift from reactive incident handling to proactive, risk-integrated incident response management. Organizations using this guidance should focus on integrating incident response capabilities across all business functions, establishing clear governance structures, implementing continuous improvement mechanisms, and utilizing the companion web resources for implementation guidance.  
  
The document is particularly relevant for CISOs, security operations teams, compliance officers, and risk management professionals who need to align their incident response capabilities with modern enterprise risk management frameworks.
