# **Week 2 - Incident Response & Security Operations**  
  
## **Executive Summary**  
  
This week builds upon foundational AI cybersecurity concepts by focusing on operational excellence in incident response and security operations. The curriculum incorporates the latest NIST SP 800-61 Revision 3 (April 2025), which aligns incident response with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0's six core functions, providing students with contemporary, evidence-based frameworks for managing AI-specific security incidents.  
  
## **Learning Objectives**  
  
By the end of this week, students will:  
  
1. **Master Contemporary Frameworks**: Apply NIST SP 800-61r3 and CSF 2.0 principles to AI-specific incident response scenarios  
2. **Design AI-Augmented SOC Operations**: Implement AI-driven Security Operations Center capabilities that enhance human analyst productivity while maintaining strategic oversight  
3. **Execute AI Incident Response**: Develop specialized incident response plans for AI systems, including model tampering, data poisoning, and adversarial attacks  
4. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Leverage AI automation to reduce alert fatigue by up to 90% while improving threat detection accuracy to 99.93%  
  
## **Module 1: Contemporary Incident Response Frameworks (3 hours)**  
  
### **1.1 NIST CSF 2.0 and SP 800-61r3 Integration**  
  
**Core Framework Understanding**  
  
The six CSF 2.0 Functions organize cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level: ++Govern (GV), Identify (ID), Protect (PR), Detect (DE), Respond (RS), and Recover (RC)++. Unlike previous versions that focused on specific technical procedures, Revision 3 emphasizes improving cybersecurity risk management across all CSF 2.0 Functions to better support organizational incident response capabilities.  
  
**Historical Evolution and Evidence Base**  
  
The shift from NIST SP 800-61r2 to r3 represents a fundamental change in incident response philosophy. Rather than prescriptive technical procedures, the new framework provides outcome-based guidance that adapts to rapidly changing technological environments. This approach is supported by extensive industry collaboration during the Biden administration's cybersecurity modernization initiative, ensuring broad applicability across sectors.  
  
**Practical Implementation**  
  
Organizations implementing CSF 2.0 report measurable improvements in incident management. The framework's emphasis on "shared responsibility" models allows organizations to leverage external expertise while maintaining clear accountability through contractual arrangements.  
  
### **1.2 AI-Specific Incident Categories**  
  
**Model Integrity Incidents**  
  
AI models face unique threats including unauthorized access, model tampering, and adversarial attacks that traditional cybersecurity frameworks don't adequately address. These incidents require specialized detection and response capabilities that consider the probabilistic nature of AI decision-making.  
  
**Data Ecosystem Breaches**  
  
Analysis of GenAI usage patterns reveals that 1 in every 80 prompts poses high risk of sensitive data leakage, with 7.5% of prompts containing potentially sensitive information. This data demonstrates the critical need for AI-specific monitoring and response protocols.  
  
**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**  
  
The complexity of AI systems creates large and dynamic attack surfaces, with attackers finding new opportunities to manipulate outcomes or extract data through model dependencies and training data sources.  
  
### **1.3 ROI and Success Metrics**  
  
**Quantifiable Outcomes**  
  
Organizations implementing modern incident response frameworks achieve significant cost reductions. IBM research demonstrates that organizations using AI and automation in security operations reduced breach lifecycle by an average of 80 days and saved an average of $1.88 million per breach.  
  
**Operational Efficiency Gains**  
  
Forrester studies show organizations leveraging AIOps experienced 50% reduction in mean time to repair (MTTR) and 50% decrease in severe incidents, demonstrating measurable operational improvements.  
  
## **Module 2: AI-Augmented Security Operations Centers (4 hours)**  
  
### **2.1 SOC Transformation Architecture**  
  
**Human-AI Collaboration Model**  
  
Harvard Business School research indicates that "AI won't replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI". This principle guides modern SOC design, where AI serves as augmentation rather than replacement, creating competitive advantage in cyber defense.  
  
**Autonomous SOC Maturity Model**  
  
The progression from Level 0 (Manual Operations) to Level 4 (Autonomous Operations) requires gradual capability building, with humans remaining essential for strategic decision-making and exception handling at every level.  
  
### **2.2 AI Integration Best Practices**  
  
**Alert Management and Triage**  
  
Modern SOCs face an average of 4,000+ daily alerts, with AI systems now capable of reducing false positives by up to 90% through sophisticated behavioral analysis. Real-world implementations demonstrate 99.93% accuracy in AI-driven triage, saving upwards of 200 analyst hours per week.  
  
**Threat Detection and Response**  
  
AI systems learn normal network and system activity patterns, then detect anomalies such as unusual login locations or abnormal file propagation in real-time. Advanced AI systems can automatically block suspicious users or isolate infected machines while keeping security teams informed.  
  
**Predictive Capabilities**  
  
Modern SOCs are shifting from reactive to proactive security postures through continuous threat intelligence integration and AI-powered prediction of attack patterns.  
  
### **2.3 Implementation Framework**  
  
**Data Management and Quality**  
  
Effective AI SOC implementation requires continuous monitoring, validation, and updating of data sources to provide accurate inputs for AI algorithms. Organizations must establish robust data governance to ensure AI system effectiveness.  
  
**Change Management**  
  
Successful AI integration requires clear communication with security teams, necessary training, and gradual integration into existing practices. This approach minimizes disruption while maximizing adoption.  
  
**Integration Challenges**  
  
Organizations face complexity in integrating AI-driven solutions with existing security tools, requiring significant time and technical expertise to ensure seamless compatibility.  
  
## **Module 3: AI-Specific Incident Response Procedures (3 hours)**  
  
### **3.1 AI Attack Vector Analysis**  
  
**Adversarial AI Threats**  
  
The 2025 threat landscape shows AI being used across the entire cyber attack lifecycle, from code generation to campaign optimization. Tools like FunkSec's AI-generated DDoS modules demonstrate how ransomware groups integrate AI into operations.  
  
**Social Engineering Evolution**  
  
Autonomous and interactive deepfakes are drastically improving the realism and scale of social engineering attacks, with real-world incidents such as AI-generated audio impersonation causing significant financial harm.  
  
**Data Poisoning and Retrieval Attacks**  
  
Modern LLMs accessing real-time information face "retrieval poisoning" risks, as demonstrated by the Russian "Pravda" network creating 3.6 million articles in 2024 that influenced AI chatbot responses 33% of the time.  
  
### **3.2 Specialized Response Protocols**  
  
**AI System Isolation Procedures**  
  
When AI model integrity is compromised, organizations must implement immediate containment without disrupting dependent business processes. This requires pre-planned degradation pathways and manual override capabilities.  
  
**Forensic Analysis of AI Systems**  
  
AI-assisted investigation involves advanced capabilities for data collection, analysis, and event reconstruction, requiring specialized tools to analyze vast amounts of log data, network traffic, and system artifacts.  
  
**Model Recovery and Validation**  
  
Post-incident recovery for AI systems requires validation of model integrity, retraining protocols, and verification of training data authenticity before restoration.  
  
### **3.3 Regulatory and Compliance Considerations**  
  
**AI Governance Frameworks**  
  
AI models require clear oversight and accountability for AI risk, including documentation of training data sources, approval workflows, and model changes. Regulations like GDPR apply fully to AI systems, especially when handling personal or sensitive customer data.  
  
**Incident Reporting Requirements**  
  
The EU AI Act sets specific rules for how AI systems must operate, including data usage restrictions and protection requirements, requiring specialized incident reporting procedures.
