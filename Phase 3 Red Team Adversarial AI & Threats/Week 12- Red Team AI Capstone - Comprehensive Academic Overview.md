# Week 12: Red Team AI Capstone - Comprehensive Academic Overview

## Context and Learning Objectives

Week 12 represents the culmination of your Red Team adversarial AI training (Weeks 9-12). By this point, you've studied adversarial ML basics, generative AI risks, and red teaming methodologies. This capstone synthesizes those concepts into a complete adversarial engagement against a machine learning system.

**Primary Objective:** Design, execute, and document a comprehensive adversarial attack on a basic ML system within a controlled laboratory environment, then provide actionable defense recommendations.

## Module 1: Threat Modeling Framework for ML Systems

### Understanding the Attack Surface

Machine learning systems present unique attack surfaces that differ fundamentally from traditional software. The **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** and **MITRE ATLAS** (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) provide structured approaches to identifying vulnerabilities.

**Key Attack Vectors:**

1. **Training Phase Attacks**
   - Data poisoning: Manipulating training data to create backdoors or degrade model performance
   - Model architecture exploitation: Targeting specific vulnerabilities in neural network designs
   - Supply chain attacks: Compromising datasets, pre-trained models, or ML libraries

2. **Inference Phase Attacks**
   - Evasion attacks: Crafting inputs that cause misclassification
   - Model extraction: Stealing model functionality through query-based reconstruction
   - Membership inference: Determining if specific data was in the training set

3. **Deployment Phase Attacks**
   - API abuse: Exploiting ML service endpoints
   - Resource exhaustion: Overwhelming systems with computationally expensive queries
   - Privacy violations: Extracting sensitive information from model responses

### Threat Actor Profiling

Your capstone should consider realistic threat actor motivations:

- **Cybercriminals:** Evading fraud detection, malware classifiers, or authentication systems
- **Nation-State Actors:** Compromising critical infrastructure ML systems or intelligence gathering
- **Insider Threats:** Leveraging privileged access to poison training data
- **Researchers:** Exposing vulnerabilities for defensive improvements (your role)

---

## Module 2: Attack Design Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Target Analysis

**System Profiling:**
Begin by thoroughly understanding your target ML system. Document:

- **Model Architecture:** Is it a decision tree, neural network, ensemble method, or deep learning model?
- **Training Data Characteristics:** What features does it use? What's the data distribution?
- **Access Level:** Do you have white-box (full access), gray-box (partial access), or black-box (query-only) access?
- **Security Posture:** What defensive measures are already implemented?

**Academic Foundation:** The work of Biggio et al. (2018) on "Wild Patterns: Ten Years After the Rise of Adversarial Machine Learning" provides comprehensive taxonomy for this analysis.

### Phase 2: Attack Vector Selection

Choose your primary attack vector based on realistic threat scenarios:

**Evasion Attacks (Most Common):**
These manipulate input data at inference time to cause misclassification. For cybersecurity applications:

- **Malware Evasion:** Adding benign features to malicious files to evade detection
- **Network Traffic Manipulation:** Crafting adversarial network packets to bypass IDS/IPS
- **Phishing URL Obfuscation:** Modifying URLs to evade ML-based phishing detectors

The mathematical foundation involves finding minimal perturbations δ to input x such that the model f(x + δ) produces incorrect output while keeping δ imperceptible or functionally equivalent.

**Data Poisoning Attacks:**
These corrupt the training process by injecting malicious samples. Particularly relevant for continuously learning systems:

- **Backdoor Attacks:** Creating hidden triggers that activate malicious behavior
- **Availability Attacks:** Degrading overall model performance
- **Targeted Attacks:** Causing specific misclassifications

Research by Gu et al. (2019) on "BadNets" demonstrates how subtle poisoning can create persistent backdoors.

**Model Extraction:**
Reconstructing a substitute model through strategic queries. This is particularly concerning for:

- Proprietary security models
- Cloud-based ML services
- Commercial threat intelligence platforms

The work of Tramèr et al. (2016) on "Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction APIs" established foundational techniques.

### Phase 3: Attack Implementation Strategy

**Constraint Analysis:**
Real-world attacks must operate under constraints:

- **Perturbation Budget:** How much can you modify inputs without detection?
- **Query Limitations:** How many API calls before rate limiting or detection?
- **Domain Constraints:** What modifications are semantically valid? (e.g., a malware binary must remain executable)

**Attack Optimization:**
Your attack should balance:
- **Effectiveness:** Success rate against the target model
- **Efficiency:** Minimal queries or perturbations required
- **Stealthiness:** Avoiding detection by monitoring systems
- **Transferability:** Whether attacks generalize across models

---

## Module 3: Execution in Controlled Environment

### Laboratory Safety Protocols

**Critical Ethical Boundaries:**

1. **Containment:** All attacks must occur in isolated lab environments with no external network access
2. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed logs of all attack attempts for accountability
3. **Responsible Disclosure:** Any novel vulnerabilities discovered must follow coordinated disclosure protocols
4. **Legal Compliance:** Ensure all activities comply with Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and equivalent regulations

**Reference Framework:** The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** provides governance structure, while **MITRE ATT&CK for ICS** offers industrial context.

### Attack Execution Process

**Iterative Refinement:**

1. **Baseline Attack:** Implement a straightforward attack based on published research
2. **Optimization:** Refine based on defensive responses and constraints
3. **Robustness Testing:** Verify attack works across different model states
4. **Documentation:** Record every decision, result, and insight

**Measurement Metrics:**

- **Attack Success Rate (ASR):** Percentage of adversarial examples that succeed
- **Perturbation Magnitude:** L∞, L2, or L0 norms measuring modification size
- **Query Efficiency:** Number of model queries required
- **Detection Rate:** How often defensive mechanisms flag the attack

---

## Module 4: Defense Recommendation Development

### Defensive Strategy Framework

Your capstone must include comprehensive defenses. The **defense-in-depth** principle applies to ML security:

**Layer 1: Input Validation and Sanitization**
- Anomaly detection on incoming data
- Input preprocessing to remove potential perturbations
- Rate limiting and query pattern analysis
- Feature squeezing to reduce attack surface

Research by Xu et al. (2017) on "Feature Squeezing" demonstrates effectiveness against adversarial examples.

**Layer 2: Model Hardening**
- Adversarial training: Including adversarial examples in training data
- Defensive distillation: Training models to be smoother and more robust
- Ensemble methods: Using multiple models with voting mechanisms
- Randomization: Adding stochasticity to model inference

**Layer 3: Runtime Monitoring**
- Prediction confidence analysis
- Input-output correlation monitoring
- Model behavior drift detection
- Anomaly detection on query patterns

**Layer 4: Response and Recovery**
- Automated fallback to rule-based systems when attacks detected
- Human-in-the-loop verification for high-stakes decisions
- Continuous model retraining with validated data
- Incident response procedures for ML-specific attacks

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Each defense has trade-offs:

**Performance vs. Security:**
- Adversarial training increases robustness but requires 2-5x more training time
- Input sanitization may reduce legitimate functionality
- Ensemble methods improve security but increase inference latency

**Accuracy vs. Robustness:**
- Defensive mechanisms often reduce accuracy on clean inputs by 1-5%
- Must determine acceptable performance degradation based on threat model

**Academic Grounding:** Papernot et al. (2016) on "Distillation as a Defense" provides empirical trade-off analysis.
