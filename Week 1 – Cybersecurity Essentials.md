# **Week 1 – Cybersecurity Essentials**

*Goal: Learn the foundations of cybersecurity concepts and set up your lab environment.*

---

## **Day 1 – CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**

### 📖 **Concepts to Learn**

* **Confidentiality** → Preventing unauthorized access to information.

  * Example: Encryption, access controls.
* **Integrity** → Ensuring data is accurate, untampered, and trustworthy.

  * Example: Hashing, digital signatures, checksums.
* **Availability** → Making sure systems and data are accessible when needed.

  * Example: Redundancy, DDoS protection, backups.

🔑 **Why it matters:** Every security control or defense mechanism you’ll learn over the next 16 weeks ultimately maps back to the CIA Triad.

---

### 🛠️ **Hands-On Exercise**

1. **Confidentiality Demo**

   * Encrypt a text file using **GPG** (Linux/Mac) or **OpenSSL** (Windows/Linux).
   * Command example (Linux/Mac):

     ```bash
     gpg -c secret.txt
     ```
   * Try decrypting it again to see how access is controlled.

2. **Integrity Demo**

   * Generate a file hash:

     ```bash
     sha256sum secret.txt
     ```
   * Edit the file slightly and hash again → notice the change.

3. **Availability Simulation**

   * Turn off your firewall or block a service temporarily.
   * Notice how it affects system availability.
   * Restart and configure redundancy where possible.

### 📚 **Suggested Readings & Videos**

* [NIST Cybersecurity Framework Introduction](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
* Book excerpt: *Computer Security: Principles and Practice* by Stallings (CIA section)
* Short video: “CIA Triad Explained Simply” (YouTube, \~5 min)

### 📝 **Quick Quiz (Self-check)**

1. What is the difference between **confidentiality** and **integrity**?
2. Give one **real-world example** where availability is critical.
3. Which part of the CIA triad would a ransomware attack violate the most?

---

📌 **Deliverable (end of Day 1):**

* Write a short paragraph (5–7 sentences) connecting **CIA Triad principles** to AI security. (Hint: Think about training data integrity, model confidentiality, and AI system uptime.)

## **Day 2 – AAA: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**

### 📖 **Concepts to Learn**

**AAA is the backbone of access control in cybersecurity:**

1. **Authentication** – Verifying *who* you are.

   * Examples: Passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   * Tools: LDAP, Active Directory, RADIUS.

2. **Authorization** – Determining *what* you’re allowed to do.

   * Examples: File permissions, role-based access control (RBAC), least privilege principle.

3. **Accounting (Auditing)** – Tracking *what* you did.

   * Examples: Logging user activity, audit trails, session tracking.

🔑 **Why it matters for AI security:**

* Authentication → Ensures only trusted engineers/data scientists can train or deploy models.
* Authorization → Controls which teams can access sensitive training datasets.
* Accounting → Logs actions, useful for investigating poisoning or model tampering.

---

### 🛠️ **Hands-On Exercise**

**Part 1: Authentication**

* On Linux/Mac: Create a new user and set a password.

  ```bash
  sudo adduser testuser
  su - testuser
  ```
* Enable **SSH key authentication** for secure login (instead of passwords).

**Part 2: Authorization**

* Restrict file access with permissions:

  ```bash
  echo "Sensitive Data" > secret.txt
  chmod 600 secret.txt
  ```

  * Try opening it as a different user — you should be denied.

**Part 3: Accounting**

* View login activity:

  ```bash
  last
  who
  ```
* Enable system logging (Linux: `journalctl` or `/var/log/auth.log`).
* Note how logs record authentication attempts.

---

### 📚 **Suggested Readings & Videos**

* NIST SP 800-63B: *Digital Identity Guidelines* (Authentication)
* OWASP: [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
* Short video: “Authentication vs. Authorization Explained” (YouTube, \~6 min)

---

### 📝 **Quick Quiz (Self-check)**

1. What is the difference between **authentication** and **authorization**?
2. Why is **accounting** crucial in forensic investigations?
3. How would MFA improve authentication security in AI model access?

---

📌 **Deliverable (end of Day 2):**
Write a short security scenario (5–6 sentences) describing:

* A system with strong authentication but weak authorization.
* How that system could be exploited.
* How you would fix it.

## **Day 3 – Network Security Basics (Firewalls, IDS, IPS)**

### 📖 **Concepts to Learn**

**1. Firewalls**

* Control network traffic based on predefined rules.
* Types:

  * Packet-filtering firewall (filters based on IP, port, protocol).
  * Stateful inspection firewall (tracks session state).
  * Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW) → includes deep packet inspection & intrusion prevention.

**2. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**

* Monitors traffic for suspicious activity and generates alerts.
* Types:

  * **NIDS** (Network-based IDS) → monitors network traffic.
  * **HIDS** (Host-based IDS) → monitors logs and activities on a single host.

**3. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**

* Similar to IDS, but can take action (block, drop, reset connections).
* IPS is often integrated with modern firewalls.

🔑 **Why it matters for AI security:**

* Firewalls protect AI models deployed via APIs.
* IDS detects unusual traffic → can spot adversarial probes.
* IPS helps prevent data exfiltration or poisoning attempts.

---

### 🛠️ **Hands-On Exercise**

**Part 1: Firewall**

* On Linux, check firewall status:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw status
  ```
* Block a specific port (e.g., port 22 for SSH):

  ```bash
  sudo ufw deny 22
  ```
* Re-enable it after testing:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 22
  ```

**Part 2: IDS**

* Install **Snort** (popular open-source IDS).

  ```bash
  sudo apt install snort -y
  ```
* Run Snort in IDS mode:

  ```bash
  sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
  ```
* Generate some network activity (ping or curl) and see if Snort logs it.

**Part 3: IPS (Optional Advanced)**

* Configure **Suricata** (IDS/IPS).
* Run it in IPS mode to automatically block malicious traffic.

### 📚 **Suggested Readings & Videos**

* Book excerpt: *Network Security Essentials* by William Stallings
* [Snort Documentation](https://www.snort.org/documents)
* Short video: “IDS vs IPS Explained” (YouTube, \~8 min)

1. What’s the key difference between an **IDS** and an **IPS**?
2. Which type of firewall is best suited for cloud environments?
3. How could an IDS help detect adversarial probing of an AI model API?

* A firewall
* An IDS
* A protected AI server hosting a model
  Explain how traffic flows and where detection/response happens.
